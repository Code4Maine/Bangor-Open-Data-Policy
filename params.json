To that extent, it's our mission in 2016 to setup a robust and sustainable open data policy and a culture in the Queen City of looking for, uploading and processing data sets wherever they may be created.\r\n\r\n### Not just for government, anymore\r\nOften when people talk about open data they think of government data. Police departments, traffic accidents, and so forth. In reality, there's lots of data that could be open from not-for-profit organizations and civic groups as well. Think hard about data that you know is being collected and add it to our list of potential data sets. We find folks to figure out the best ways to open the data up so the data can be used by anyone and everyone.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
