City of Chattanooga's Open Data Policy and Specification
========================================================

### **Expectations**
This posting of the proposed open data policy and specification is an opportunity to garner greater input and feedback before the final version of the open data policy and specification is enacted. 

There should be certain expectations about the ability to change verbatim whatever your suggestion or input may be. Given that the policy and specfication must go through the Mayor's office, Information Technology and the City Attorney's office, some suggestions may interpreted or translated to match required legal terms and definitions.
