City of Chattanooga's Open Data Policy and Specification
========================================================

### **Timeline**
The open data policy and specification language will be taken from Github on **April 7th 2014** to be crafted into the final legal langauge needed for the policy. Once the final language is complete and the policy is enacted, the policy and specification will be placed back on Github as well as on the City's website at www.chattanooga.gov and open data portal to be hosted at www.data.chattanooga.gov. 

### **Expectations**
This posting of the proposed open data policy and specification is an opportunity to garner greater input and feedback before the final version of the open data policy and specification is enacted. 

There should be certain expectations about the ability to change verbatim whatever your suggestion or input may be. Given that the policy and specfication must go through the Mayor's office, Information Technology and the City Attorney's office, some suggestions may interpreted or translated to match required legal terms and definitions.
